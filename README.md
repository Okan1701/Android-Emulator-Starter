# Android-Emulator-Starter
A small C# (.NET) tool that you can use to start an Android Emulator without having to use the command line

I created this small tool because I grew tired of having to use the command prompt to start a virtual device which would involve several commands.
This tool is aimed to automate it a bit more.<br>

When running the tool, it will display all created emulators and ask you which one you want to start.<br>

And ofcourse, when you make a choice it will automatically start that device.

The application is currently WIP and may bug out.
